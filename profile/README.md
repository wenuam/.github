# wenuam

Meaningful development studio with a mindset.

Software architecture, project management, embedded system.

## Repositories

The naming convention is from general to specific :
* wm : wenuam's compact form
* key : 2 or 3 chars for the section
* name : repository name or subsection (like key)
* __impl : specific implementation (optional)

Some repositories may be used in another as submodule, often using only their name with no prefix.

Such repositories may not keep a complete history and scrub old binaries, pulling must be forced.
